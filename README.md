# TypeSledder

Main repository for the TypeSledder game.

This project will be built in ...Godot? and will serve as a small game for my entry into development and design.

## Goals

The release goal is **March 31st**. The MVP will be an endless game which you can plan with some type of continuous generation while typing words. You can see the game design document [here](typesledder_gdd.pdf).

## Roadmap

Below is a checklist to the roadmap for this project. You can find a Trello board of currently working issues [here](https://trello.com/b/aWuTQPqG).
